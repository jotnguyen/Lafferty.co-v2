# Hi, Iâ€™m Nick Lafferty.

I am a digital marketer with a passion for technology and SaaS products based in Austin, Texas. I currently work at [Mailgun](https://mailgun.com) where I'm helping define and execute our digital marketing strategy. 

I enjoy building charts and dashboards, tinkering with websites, and solving problems.

This website is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and [Netlify](https://netlify.com), and the source is available [Github](https://github.com/NLaff/lafferty.co-v2).

Do you need help generating more leads, running paid search campaigns, or building a website? [Send me an email.](mailto:nick@lafferty.co)
