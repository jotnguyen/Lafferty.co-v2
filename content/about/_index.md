## Hi, Iâ€™m Nick.

I am a digital marketer with a passion for technology and SaaS products based in Austin, Texas. I am the paid media manager for [Mailgun](https://mailgun.com) and my background is in lead generation. 

I enjoy building charts, dashboards, tinkering with websites, and solving problems.      

This website is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and [Netlify](https://netlify.com), and the source is available [Github](https://github.com/NLaff/lafferty.co-v2).
