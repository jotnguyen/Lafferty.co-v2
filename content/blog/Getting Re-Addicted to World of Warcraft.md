# Getting Re-Addicted to World of Warcraft

I started playing World of Warcraft when I was 16, as an awkward, nerdy teenager in high school. I wasn't a great student, I got ok grades, I didn't play sports, and the only club I joined was the Latin Foreign Language Club. Yeah, high school was rough for me. 

Since then, the game has changed drastically in more ways than are worth recounting here. WoW today is now a very different game then when it was released in 2006. Which is why Blizzard released World of Warcraft Classic, a true recreation of original WoW. 

In Aprilt this year, Blizzard announced the release date of WoW:Classic, set for August 27th. I had 3 months to prepare.

Man, I was excited. WoW:Classic came at a perfect time in my life. I had just married the love of my life, changed jobs, and started working remotely from home. I was so excited to re-live my adventures with my wife. 16 year old me
