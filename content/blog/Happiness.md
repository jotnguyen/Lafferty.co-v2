# How I stay Ridiculously Happy All The Time

All it takes is understanding what makes you and the people around you happy. 



It was 5:30pm, and yesterday my wife couldn't find some important work that was due that night. I walk into the office to find her in tears. I tried to console her and help look for the files, but they were gone. She had to redo the work right then. At the end of the day when all she wanted was to get off the computer and relax. 

I couldn't help her with the work. So I made her dinner. And I walked the dog. I tried to make the rest of her night as easy as possible.

During my walk I started asking myself "Why am I so happy all the time?". Even when things go horribly wrong, I seem to have this uncanny ability to just brush it off and move on. 

### Say Outloud What You're Grateful For

I started verbalizing the things I'm grateful for in my life. Sometimes I'll say them to my wife. Sometimes I say them to a wall, or when I'm in the car. Putting those words out there helps reinforce the good things we have going on in our life. Some of mine are really simple:

* Having dinner with my wife every day.
* A comfy couch to write on.
* My dog
* I'm starting to see results from my lunchtime workouts.

Your list is certaintly different than mine. The important part is to focus on the things that make you happy.

### Make Yourself Earn it

I love In-n-Out. Even as a lifelong Texan I feel that In-n-Out is miles better than Whataburger.

But I can't go there all the time



### Delay Gratification

My wife loves walking around stores, especially Target. Something about casually browsing the shelves helps put her at ease.

Often I'll find something I like. A pair of pants. A dope sweater with a bear on it.

She'll encourage me to buy it. I almost never do.

She thinks I'm insane for finding things I like and then never actually buying them.

But I don't get joy from buying those things. I get joy from spending time with her.

Every once in a while I'll find something I really like.
