I work for an email company. Here's the biggest mistake I see our users making. 

**Grow an email subscriber list**.

That's common advice here on Medium. And it's good advice for a reason.

Email is a direct and easy way to communicate with your audience. 

I see a lot of email campaigns in my day job working for one of the largest email service providers. Our users send billions of email every month.

The biggest mistake I see our users making with their email campaigns is also one of the easiest to fix. 

### You're spamming people

Some of your subscribers are no longer interested in your emails. Maybe they've maximized all of the value you can provide them. Perhaps their interests and priorities have changed, or they've moved on to a new hobby. 

That's totally ok. You can't please everyone. In fact, desperately holding onto subscribers that are uninterested in your content is hurting your newsletter.

Inbox providers, like Gmail and Yahoo, care a lot about how users interact with your emails. It's in their best interest to protect users from spam, and they're ruthless about it. They've built complicated algorithms to detect spam and make sure it never reaches the inbox.

Gmail now prompts users to unsubscribe from emails they haven't opened recently.

Your emails could end up in the spam folder if you don't do one specific thing.  All your hard work building that subscriber list goes right out the window if all your emails never make it to the inbox. 

### Start respecting your subscribers

On average there are [111 billion commercial emails sent every day](https://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/email-marketing/2019/05/shocking-truth-about-how-many-emails-sent/). Chances are your subscribers receive *tons of emails.*

Your newsletter is just one email of the hundreds they receive every day.  

The good news is that you can easily tell which subscribers are still interested in your emails based on their engagement. Here's some positive engagement signals in the eyes of Gmail and Yahoo:

- Opening your email
- Clicking a link from your email
- Replying
- Forwarding your email to a friend

There's also negative engagement:

- Deleting your emails
- Marking them as spam
- Repeatedly not opening them.

The average open rate is about 21%, and the average click rate is about 2.6%, [according to Mailchimp.](https://mailchimp.com/resources/email-marketing-benchmarks/) 

Take a look at your most recent campaign and see how you compare. 

### Supercharge your next newsletter

You have a major weapon to avoid landing in the spam folder. But only a small percent of users I see actually do this. 

You need to remove subscribers from your email list. 

It may seem heartbreaking to remove someone from your email list. You worked hard for that subscriber! Why take them out of your email list?

Let me explain. 

Negative engagement signals are weighted heavier than positive ones. Inbox providers have a very low tolerance for spam. 

A spam rate below 0.1% is considered normal. That means for every 1000 emails you send, only one can be marked as spam. Anything above that is considered a high spam rate by major inbox providers. 

Once you get flagged with a high spam rate it's very difficult to fix your reputation. Avoid it at all costs.

**My suggestion:** Get rid of users who haven't opened your emails in 3 months

But what if those users would open your next newsletter? That mindset will trick you into keeping unengaged users in your email list and puts you on the fast track to the spam folder.

The reality is they haven't engaged in the last 3 months. It's very unlikely they'll start engaging in the future.

### What do you have to lose?

Test it out and see what happens.

Take your current subscriber list, copy it, then create a new list without your unengaged users. 

Set a reminder to periodically clean out your email list. Your unengaged users will thank you, and inbox providers will look at you more favorably too. 

You just increased the chance of your future emails landing in the inbox.
